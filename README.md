The project consists of an implementation of Federated Learning, a machine learning approach that allows devices to learn from distributed data without sharing it centrally. 

The system architecture is based on a client-server model. Clients train on their local data and send the model weights to the server. 

The server aggregates the weights received from the clients and coordinates the entire simulation process.

The dataset, downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic, consists of 30 features plus an identifier and associated target.
